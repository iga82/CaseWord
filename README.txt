Case Word, an IDE/word processor to help remove the hinderance of writing legal documents and citing resources.

Created over the span of 3 days, at the 3 day startup event.
My contribution was working on the most important backend feature (the highlight and automatic past functionality) and helping with the data store, and some of the front end.

I learned javascript and Django over the span of the 3 days.  In addition I learned valuable marketing and buisness aspects of startup companies, such as market validation and scalability.  Our team consisted of 2 computer science majors (including me), 1 graduate economic major, 1 electrical engineering major, and 1 law student.
